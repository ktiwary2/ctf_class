# Capture the Flag
## Course project

1) create virtual conda environment from yml file or manually
2) install OpenAI GYM and PyGame using pip if needed
3) install Cap-Env using python setup script (look at alias.txt file for example)
4) try it by running cap_learn.py
5) design the control algorithm that generates control actions (vector of 6 integers from 0 to 4). You may use only observations give by the environment.
6) your goal is :
  * find the enemy flag
  * pass through enemy patrol
  * capture the enemy flag using ground units
  * survive
